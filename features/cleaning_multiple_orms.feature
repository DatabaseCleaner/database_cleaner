Feature: database cleaning using multiple ORMs
  In order to ease example and feature writing
  As a developer
  I want to have my database in a clean state

  # Scenario Outline: ruby app with adapter gems
  #   Given I am using <ORM1> and <ORM2> from their adapter gems

  #   When I run my scenarios that rely on clean databases using multiple orms
  #   Then I should see all green
